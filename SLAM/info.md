# SLAM

basic implemtnation of [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) from the ground up w/o looking at pre-made algorithms   

idea: we will generate mazes then make a "crawler" to crawl those mazes and map out the scope


Note: I didn't import any specific package so I'm just assuming that the maze generation algorithms are in a folder (as they are now) in current directory. (a.k.a: This is unstable code.)
